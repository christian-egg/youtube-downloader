# youtube-downloader [Outdated]

A program that takes in a list of youtube video links and downloads them as mp3s or mp4s.

# Note: 

Likely due to changes to YouTube's layout, my Selenium code no longer seems to function (it used specific element tags to navigate through pages).  
As this was only meant to be a fun side project during my Freshman year, I will not be updating it. This repository's purpose is only to document a part of my growth as a developer.
